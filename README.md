# Project Title

Inventory Management System (IMS) run in the Command Line Interface (CLI) providing the ability to perform create, read, update and delete methods (CRUD), on customers, orders and items. 

## How it Works

This project is fairly easy to use and simple to navigate. It gives the user a starting menu to navigate into customer,
items, and order menus to manipulate the data from those menus. The options to manipulate data are for the most part the same across 
the menus. Create(ADD) :heavy_plus_sign:, Update :recycle:, Delete :x: & View All :eyes: are the main features used to access the information in the database.
